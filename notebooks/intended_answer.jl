# Task due June 7th: Build a table from two random csv data files 
## Include: subject (participant ID), uid (SEQ ID), subject_age, project 

using CSV 
using BiobakeryUtils
using DataFrames
using Microbiome


## What I expected to be done:

# First: read and figure out what is in both files.269x269

table01 = CSV.read("data_ext/Biospecimens.csv", DataFrame; stringtype = String)
## table 01 has uid, loolks like a bunch of Biospeimen IDs, they lookf like FEXXXXX. I do now know wha t a Biospecimen is. note: ask what a Biospecimen is..269x269
## table 01 has subject (! i need subject !)
## table 01 has project (project is a string, and has ["resonance", "lake_waban", missing, "khula", "march"] ), I dont know what any onf those names mean. Not: ask.
## tabke 01 has subject_age. already numerical.
## table 01 has collection. it is a bunch on integer numbers. Values are [missing, 2, 1, 4, 3, 9, 5, 12, 6, 8, 7, 10, 11, 13]. I dont know what it means.
## table 01 has seqprer, loolks like a bunch of IDs, they lookf like SEQXXXXX. I do now know what a seqprer is, but i need it (!!!)
## table 01 has aliases, its a string, it has a bunch of character notations, loks like IDS, i still dont know what the IDs mean.
## table 01 has visit. It looks like it encodes the time of collection, like "3 months". "6 months" and so on.
## table 01 has ....

table02 = CSV.read("data_ext/SequencingPrep.csv", DataFrame; stringtype = String)
## table 02 has uid, loolks like a bunch of SEQ IDs, they look like SEQXXXXX. I do now know what a SEQID is, but i need it (!!!)
## table 02 has subject (! i need subject !)
## table 02 has project (project is a string, and has ["resonance", "lake_waban", missing, "khula", "march"] ), I dont know what any onf those names mean. Not: ask.
## tabke 02 has subject_age. already numerical.
## table 02 has collection. it is a bunch on integer numbers. Values are [missing, 2, 1, 4, 3, 9, 5, 12, 6, 8, 7, 10, 11, 13]. I dont know what it means.
